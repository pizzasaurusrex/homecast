# homecast — Plan

A small Raspberry Pi service that exposes your Google Home / Nest speakers as
AirPlay targets, so you can play Apple Music (or anything else on iOS) to them
with native AirPlay controls. Thin wrapper around
[philippe44/AirConnect](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect) that adds
lifecycle management, a web dashboard, and a one-line installer.

### Recent fixes

- **CI lint unblock** — [PR #1](https://github.com/pizzasaurusrex/homecast/pull/1): golangci-lint binary was built with Go 1.24 but go.mod targets 1.25; switched to `go install` + added `.golangci.yml`.

### Next actions (in order)

1. M3 is sliced into four PRs to keep each reviewable:
   1. `internal/logs` ring-buffer `io.Writer` (merged, [PR #3](https://github.com/pizzasaurusrex/homecast/pull/3)).
   2. `internal/api` stdlib `net/http` mux + JSON handlers ([PR #4](https://github.com/pizzasaurusrex/homecast/pull/4); review follow-up commit pending).
   3. `web/` vanilla HTML/CSS/JS UI served via `embed` (decision: no framework — see `project_ui_framework_decision.md`).
   4. Wire serve mode into `cmd/homecast`; extract saved⨯discovered device merge so `--dry-run` and the API share one source of truth.
2. Manual E2E on the Pi: prove an iPhone can AirPlay to a Google Home via the bridge controlled from the UI.

### Deferred follow-ups

- **mDNS TTL cache for `/api/devices`** — every GET currently triggers a 3 s mDNS browse. A polling UI will flood the LAN and stall each call. Add a short TTL cache (10–30 s) with an explicit `?refresh=1` bypass. File once slice 4 lands so we have real traffic to measure.

### Open questions still deferred

- Hostname: rely on `homecast.local` via avahi (Pi OS ships it) or document alternative?
- API auth: none in v1 (LAN assumption). Add token header in v2?
- Logging format: `log/slog` JSON; acceptable for operators?

## 1. Problem

Apple Music can AirPlay to Samsung TVs/soundbars (Samsung licensed AirPlay 2)
but not to Google Home / Nest speakers (Google never licensed AirPlay, pushes
its own Cast protocol instead). AirConnect solves the protocol bridging but is
a bare binary with a config file — not friendly to set up, monitor, or tweak.

homecast makes it trivial:

1. Flash an SD card, run one install command on the Pi.
2. Open `http://homecast.local` from any device on your network.
3. See discovered Google Homes, toggle which ones to expose, restart the
   bridge, view logs.
4. Pick up your iPhone, open Apple Music, AirPlay to the living-room Home.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Not** a reimplementation of AirPlay or Google Cast protocols. We wrap
  AirConnect, with a fork-and-maintain fallback if upstream goes dark.
- **Not** a cloud service. Everything runs on the user's LAN.
- **Not** a macOS / Windows / generic-Linux app for v1. Target is Raspberry Pi
  with Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based). Other platforms are easy follow-ups.
- **Not** a replacement for the Apple Music app. Music control stays in the
  native app via AirPlay.
- **Not** an iOS app in v1. iOS Shortcuts pack is a v2 stretch goal.

`homecast` is **not** in the audio path. It supervises AirConnect, discovers
devices, writes AirConnect's config file, and serves the UI. The audio goes
iPhone → AirConnect → Google Home directly.

### Components

- **AirConnect binary** — downloaded at install time from philippe44's official
  releases. Managed as a subprocess by `homecast`.
- **homecast daemon** (Go, single static binary):
  - Process supervisor for AirConnect (start/stop/restart, log capture,
    crash-restart with backoff)
  - mDNS discovery of `_googlecast._tcp` devices
  - Config file generator for AirConnect (XML)
  - HTTP API + embedded web UI
- **Web UI** — minimal SPA served at `/`. Plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no
  framework. Embedded via Go's `embed` so the binary is self-contained.
- **systemd unit** — keeps `homecast` running across reboots.
- **Installer script** — `install.sh` downloads latest homecast + AirConnect,
  installs systemd unit, starts service.

### Data flow (happy path)

1. User flashes Pi, runs `curl -fsSL https://.../install.sh | sh`
2. `homecast.service` starts. Daemon comes up, begins mDNS discovery.
3. First-run state: no devices enabled. User opens `http://homecast.local`,
   toggles their speakers on.
4. Daemon writes AirConnect config, starts AirConnect.
5. AirConnect registers each enabled Google Home as an AirPlay receiver via
   mDNS (`_raop._tcp`).
6. iPhone sees them in the AirPlay picker, user plays music.

### HTTP API surface

| Method | Path                          | Purpose                              |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/status`                 | Bridge state, uptime, AirConnect ver |
| GET    | `/api/devices`                | Discovered Cast devices + enabled    |
| POST   | `/api/devices/:id/enable`     | Expose device as AirPlay target      |
| POST   | `/api/devices/:id/disable`    | Stop exposing                         |
| POST   | `/api/bridge/restart`         | Restart AirConnect                    |
| GET    | `/api/logs?tail=N`            | Recent AirConnect log lines           |
| GET    | `/api/config`                 | Current config (debug)                |

No auth in v1 — single-home LAN assumption. Token auth is a v2 consideration.

### Config

`/etc/homecast/config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  listen: "0.0.0.0:8080"
airconnect:
  binary_path: /usr/local/lib/homecast/aircast
  log_path: /var/log/homecast/aircast.log
  auto_restart: true
devices:
  - id: "kitchen-home._googlecast._tcp.local."
    name: "Kitchen Home"
    enabled: true
```

Every `internal/` package ships with its own `_test.go`. Target ≥80%
statement coverage, enforced in CI.

## 5. Milestones

Sizing is "weekend-ish evenings" — not calendar days.

### M1 — Skeleton + CI (first evening)

- Initialize Go module `github.com/<user>/homecast`
- `cmd/homecast/main.go` prints version; `--version` flag works
- MIT LICENSE, initial README
- GitHub Actions `ci.yml`: `go test`, `go vet`, `gofmt -l`, `golangci-lint`,
  coverage upload
- GitHub Actions `release.yml`: cross-compile for `linux/armv7`, `linux/arm64`,
  `linux/amd64` on tag push; publish binaries + SHA256 checksums
- Repo pushed public

**Done when:** CI green on main, tagged `v0.0.1` release produces downloadable
armv7 + arm64 binaries.

### M2 — Core daemon (second evening)

- `internal/config`: YAML load/save, schema validation, defaults
- `internal/discovery`: mDNS browse for `_googlecast._tcp`, returns structured
  device list, tested with mock mDNS responses
- `internal/bridge`: subprocess manager — start/stop/restart, stdout/stderr
  capture, exponential backoff restart on crash, AirConnect XML config
  generation from our YAML
- Unit tests for each package, ≥80% coverage

**Done when:** `homecast --dry-run` prints discovered devices and the
AirConnect config it would write, without actually launching AirConnect.

### M3 — HTTP API + Web UI (third evening)

- `internal/api`: Gorilla-style router (or `net/http` + `http.ServeMux` — stdlib
  preferred), JSON handlers per API spec above
- Web UI: single page, three sections (status / devices / logs), vanilla JS
  fetching from `/api/*`
- Go `embed` for static assets
- `httptest`-based handler tests
- Manual E2E: run on the Pi, AirPlay from iPhone to a Google Home end-to-end

**Done when:** an iPhone can AirPlay Apple Music to a Google Home via the
bridge, controlled via the web UI from another device.

### M4 — Installer + systemd + release polish (fourth evening)

- `scripts/install.sh`: detects arch, downloads latest homecast release +
  latest AirConnect `aircast` binary, installs systemd unit, enables + starts
  service, prints URL to visit
- `scripts/uninstall.sh`: reverses M4
- `systemd/homecast.service`: `After=network-online.target`, `Restart=always`
- `test/integration/install_test.sh`: runs installer inside a Docker container
  (ubuntu:22.04 + systemd), asserts the service comes up healthy. AirConnect
  binary is mocked here — we test the installer, not AirConnect itself.
- README quickstart with one-line install command

**Done when:** fresh Pi OS install → one curl command → working bridge,
reproducible from scratch, integration test gates CI.

### M5 — iOS Shortcuts pack (stretch, post-v1)

- Shortcuts for: enable/disable each speaker, restart bridge, show status
- Shortcuts call the homecast API over local network
- Siri phrases like "Hey Siri, enable kitchen speaker"
- Published as downloadable `.shortcut` files in the repo

## 6. Testing strategy

- **Unit** — `go test ./...` on every package in `internal/`. Table-driven where
  it fits. Coverage ≥80%, reported in CI, visible in PR comments.
- **Integration** — `httptest` for the API layer (real handlers, real routes,
  fake dependencies). Docker-based installer test for the release path.
- **Manual E2E** — run on the Pi with a real Google Home and iPhone. Documented
  smoke-test checklist in the README; no automation (would require real
  hardware).
- **Linting** — `gofmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` (default config + revive,
  gocyclo, errcheck, ineffassign).
- **Race detector** — `go test -race` in CI.

## 7. CI/CD

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Triggers: push, pull_request.

Jobs:
- `lint` — gofmt check, `go vet`, `golangci-lint run`
- `test` — matrix over Go 1.22 and 1.23; `go test -race -cover ./...`;
  upload coverage to Codecov
- `build` — `go build` for `linux/armv7` and `linux/arm64` to catch
  cross-compile regressions
- `integration` — run `test/integration/install_test.sh` in Docker

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Triggers: tag push matching `v*`.

- Cross-compile for `linux/armv7`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`
- Generate SHA256 checksums
- Create GitHub release with binaries + checksums attached
- `install.sh` reads `latest` release from the GitHub API

### Versioning

Semver. `v0.x` while we're pre-stable; `v1.0.0` when M1-M4 are production-quiet
for 2+ weeks on the maintainer's own Pi.

## 8. Risks & mitigations

| Risk                                       | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| AirConnect upstream abandoned              | Low-Med    | MIT licensed — fork-and-maintain path is available              |
| Apple breaks AirPlay compatibility         | Low        | Same as above; philippe44 has historically kept up              |
| Pi 3 underpowered for transcoding          | Very Low   | AirConnect runs fine on Pi 3 per upstream docs                  |
| mDNS issues on VLAN/mesh-Wi-Fi setups      | Medium     | Document in README; consider mDNS reflector guidance for v2     |
| First-run discovery empty (nothing to toggle) | Low     | UI shows a helpful "no devices found yet" state + troubleshooting link |
| Binary release pipeline regressions        | Low        | Integration test in CI catches installer breakage pre-tag       |

## 9. Open questions

1. **Hostname** — default to `homecast.local` via avahi/mDNS? Most Pi OS images
   ship with avahi; we can assume it but document.
2. **Config format** — YAML chosen; reconsider if operators push back.
3. **Auth on the API** — none in v1. v2 could add a shared-token header for
   users with hostile roommates. Document the assumption clearly.
4. **Logging** — structured JSON logs from the daemon (useful) vs. plain text
   (simpler). Going with `log/slog` JSON output, pretty by default in TTY.
5. **Metrics** — Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for v2? Low priority.

## 10. Out of scope for v1 (explicitly)

- AirPlay 2 multi-room sync (AirConnect is AirPlay 1 for Cast devices)
- Spotify Connect / other sources (AirConnect does this too but keep scope tight)
- Windows / macOS host support
- Grouped Google Home targets via our UI (configurable in AirConnect directly,
  UI wrapper is v2)
- Automatic AirConnect version updates (users re-run `install.sh` for now)
